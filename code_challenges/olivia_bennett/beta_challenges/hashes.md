# Hashing It Out

## Movies

Manually create a hash with the following keys/values:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| 'Hitchcock' | ['Rear Window']|
| 'Truffaut' | ['400 Blows'] |
| 'Myers'  | ['Austin Powers', 'Shrek']|
| 'fruit' | 'banana' |

Programmatically do the following:

1. `fruit` and `banana` aren't movies! Delete them from the hash.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

2. Add "The Birds" to the `Hitchcock` array.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

3. Remove `Shrek`.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

4. Return all of the keys.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

5. Return all the values.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

Programmatically do the following:

1. Return the string `"Riding ponies"`

```ruby

## The Most Ridiculous Grocery List

Create a hash with keys representing the following foods: avocados, steak, grass, whiskey, muffins, fish, and soap.

Avocados are fresh, steak is meaty, grass is fiber-filled, whiskey is smooth, muffins are sweet, fish is mercury-tastic, and soap is disgusting. Here is some starter code:

Starter code:
```
groceries = {
  avocados: "fresh",
  steak: "meaty",
}
```
Programmatically do the following:

1. Avocados are full of that good fat. Change the avocado value to be "fatty".

```ruby
# write your code here
```

2. Muffins are super unhealthy. Change the value for muffins to be "carbtastic".

```ruby
# write your code here
```

3. Soap? Who would eat soap? Delete that from your hash.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

4. The fish went bad. The flavor of fish should be "rotten".

```ruby
# write your code here
```

5. Juice cleanse! Add "raw carrot juice" to your hash with the flavor "wallet-draining good".

```ruby
# write your code here
```

6. Atkins diet! Get those muffins out of that hash.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

7. Time to dry yourself out. Delete whiskey from the hash.

```ruby
# write your code here
```

8. You just moved to Park Slope and joined the co-op! Add "gluten free bread" to your hash with the flavor "sadness".

```ruby
# write your code here
```

9. Time to fast. Delete everything from the hash!

```ruby
# write your code here
```
