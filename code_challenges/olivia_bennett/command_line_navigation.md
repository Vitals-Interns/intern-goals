# Star Wars, the Command Line, and The Battle for the Fate of the Universe

Working in the command line is a key skill to develop as a programmer. It's a big break from what you're used to, and practice makes (eventually) perfect. Let's explore the Star Wars narrative using the command line, and ONLY the command line.

## A New Hope
### Act I

* In your personal folder, create a directory called `star_wars`

* In your `star_wars` folder, create two new directories - `empire` and `rebellion`.

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `darth_vader`

* Use the force (or your knowledge of the command line) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the `darth_vader` file. (Don't know how to do this? Use the 'other force', known as Google!)

* Inside the empire directory, create a .txt file called `emperor_palpatine`.

* Inside the empire directory, create a directory called `death_star`

* Move `darth_vader` into the `death_star`

### Act II

* Move back to your `star_wars` directory, and enter the `rebellion` directory

* Create a .txt file called `princess_leia` and add the text 'Help me, Obi-Wan...You're my only hope.'

* Create a .txt file called `obi_wan`

* Create a .txt file called `luke_skywalker`

* Create a directory called `millenium_falcon`

* Inside the `millenium_falcon`, create two .txt files: `han_solo` and `chewy`

* Move `luke_skywalker`, `obi-wan`, and `princess_leia` into the `millenium_falcon`

* Move the `millenium_falcon` into the `death_star`

### Act III

* Unload the Millenium Falcon! Move the whole crew from the `millenium_falcon` directory into the `death_star` directory

* `darth_vader` has defeated `obi_wan`! Delete poor `obi_wan`

* Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the `millenium_falcon`!

* Move the `millenium_falcon` back into the `rebellion` directory

* `darth_vader` leaves the `death_star` to pursue Luke! Move him from the `death_star` into the `empire` directory

* Thanks to his practice back home at Beggar's Canyon, Luke blew up the death star! Remove it from the galaxy!
